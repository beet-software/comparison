## Getting started

To start using this package, just run

```shell
dart pub add comparison
dart pub get
```

or, if you're using Flutter,

```shell
flutter pub add comparison
flutter pub get
```

See [`pub add` command](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-add) for more information.

## Usage

This package only exports a single class, `Comparator`, which you can import as below:

```dart
import 'package:comparison/comparison.dart';

final Comparator<String> comparator = Comparator.naturalOrder();
```

You can now use it to

- compare two values:

```dart
final String name = 'John Doe';
final bool manGoesFirst = comparator(name, 'Jane Doe') > 0;
// Same as: final bool manGoesFirst = name > 'Jane Doe';
```

- provide an argument to `List#sort`:

```dart

final List<String> values = ["b", "c", "a"];
values.sort(comparator);

print(values); // [a, b, c]
```

- compare multiple fields:

```dart

final Comparator<String> reversed = comparator.reversed().thenComparingBy((v) => v.length);
```

Take a look at the API reference for more usage information. You can also go through examples in
the *example/* directory.

## Additional information

This package is heavily based on JDK's comparison API. You can take a look at
[Comparators.java](https://github.com/frohoff/jdk8u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/Comparators.java),
[Comparator.java](https://github.com/frohoff/jdk8u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/Comparator.java) and
[Collections.java](https://github.com/frohoff/jdk8u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/Collections.java)
for the base implementation.
